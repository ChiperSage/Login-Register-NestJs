### Auth System with NestJS

This project is an authentication system built with **NestJS**, implementing registration, login, and logout functionality. It uses **TypeORM** for database interactions and includes **DTO-based validation** using `class-validator` to ensure user inputs are correctly formatted. Features include:

- User registration with validation (e.g., minimum username length, email format).
- Password hashing for secure storage.
- Login with session management.
- User session handling with logout functionality.
- Built with modular architecture and fully customizable templates for login and registration views.
